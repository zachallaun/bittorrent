"""
The HandshakeTranslator translates a stream of bytes into higher level messages
and vice versa related to the handshake between BitTorrent peers.  The bytes are
exchanged with a readerwriter and the higher level messages are exchanged with a
receiver.  The creator of the HandshakeTranslator must subsequently provide it 
with a readerwriter using the set_readerwriter() method.  When it no longer 
needs the HandshakeTranslator, it should call the unset_readerwriter() method so
that all references to the HandshakeTranslator can be released and it can be 
properly garbage collected.

On the receiver side, when told to transmit a handshake message, the 
HandshakeTranslator generates a set of bytes to send to the readerwriter.  When
the readerwriter presents the HandshakeTranslator with a set of bytes that
represent a handshake message, the translator notifies the receiver.  It also
notifies the receiver when a non-handshake message is received or the
connection is lost.

A receiver must implement three methods, rx_handshake(), rx_non_handshake and
connection_lost().  

On the readerwriter side, when incoming bytes are available, the readerwriter
asks the HandshakeTranslator for a buffer to put them into and after it has
done that, it notifies the translator that bytes have been received.  This
scheme allows the HandshakeTranslator to get enough bytes to translate the
next part of the message expected.  

A readerwriter must implement set_receiver(), unset_receiver() and tx_bytes()

Right now, the HandshakeTranslor reports the handshake after it has received
the peer_id but documentation seems to indicate it should do this right after
receiving the info_hash.

Would it make sense to make a Translator base class with common code which all 
the actual translators would inherit from?
